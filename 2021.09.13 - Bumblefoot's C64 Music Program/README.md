# Ron "Bumblefoot" Thal's C64 Music Program
Program listings for Bumblefoot's C64 music program, posted as a [photo of a hand-written prorgram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24281560/133116389-40835b97-d71e-4b70-9460-4d900420b7da.png) listing from the 1980s!

Two program listings are shown, both including corrections to syntax errors in the transcription.  The "original" program removes a modification I added to halt playing sound while the program waits for user input.
